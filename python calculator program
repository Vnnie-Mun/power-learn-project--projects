Here's a simple Python program that works as described:

```python
# Basic Calculator Program

# Ask user to input two numbers and an operator
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
operator = input("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the operation and print the result
if operator == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
elif operator == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
elif operator == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
elif operator == '/':
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print("Invalid operator. Please enter one of +, -, *, /.")
```

### Sample Output:

```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

Let me know if you want this with a graphical interface or as a loop that runs multiple times.
